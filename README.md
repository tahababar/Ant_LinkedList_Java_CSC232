# Ant_LinkedList_Java_CSC232
An ant chain project for my Object Oriented Software Development class

An ant chain and an ant class are created for this project to practice non-primitive types. Normal methods like add to start, add to end, add at position, connect 2 chains etc. are implemented. The ant chain will work similar to a doubly linked list.
